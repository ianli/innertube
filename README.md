Innertube Widgets API
=====================

The Innertube Widgets API is used to create widgets of personal informatics visualizations for users to add to their [Innertube Dashboard](http://innertube.me).

Innertube Widgets API is dependent on these great open-source projects:

* [easyXDM](http://easyxdm.net/) for cross-domain messaging
* [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) for utility functions

To get started, visit http://ianli.github.com/innertube/!


Usage
-----

To start using the Innertube Widgets API, copy this snippet into the widget you are building:

``` html
<script src="http://ianli.github.com/innertube/javascripts/easyXDM-2.4.15.118/easyXDM.js"></script>
<script src="http://ianli.github.com/innertube/javascripts/underscore-1.2.2.js"></script>
<script src="http://ianli.github.com/innertube/0.1.0/innertube.js"></script>
```

To test your widget in the Innertube Dashboard, sign up for an account at [Innertube](http://innertube.me) and add your widget.


Versioning
----------

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor
